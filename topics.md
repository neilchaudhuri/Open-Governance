 * **Session Title**: Here's What's Trending In Software Engineering
 * **Preferred Timeframe**: Any weeknight
 * **Event Type**: Lightning Talk (~30 minutes with questions)
 * **Summary**: One of the great things about working in software engineering is all the new technology that pops up every day. So many new options are arriving on the open-source and commercial landscapes that give us levels of productivity, functionality, performance, and security we‚Äôve never enjoyed before. Then again, constantly changing technology is also one of the intimidating things about working in software engineering. This talk will explore major trends in software engineering you should know so you can be prepared for what‚Äôs coming, and in some cases what‚Äôs already here, and evaluate how they can add value to your current projects.
